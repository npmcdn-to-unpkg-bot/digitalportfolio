# digitalportfolio 0.1

A Custom WordPress Theme built for artists to display their work.  This theme organizes images into sets of galleries and provides a contact form page template.   All images and URLs are SEO by default and the theme is built to degrade gracefully to all browsers.  It by default will load a javascript image gallery that can be clicked through but if javascript is disabled, there is a php programmed image gallery to fall back on.  This is the earliest version of the theme, I tried to make the code as clean as possible but it will be refactored before 0.2.

## Dependencies 

- WordPress
- jQuery
- RequireJS (for development)
